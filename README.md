## Problem Statement : 
One of the most difficult challenges any group project faces is the coordination of meeting times and locations around schedules. This becomes increasingly so as more members are added to the team. In addition, most of the tools currently available for group scheduling purposes dont encompass the full scope of user needs, often only focusing on schedule organization or sharing but not deciding upon meeting locations. 

Right now these services merely collect useful and relevant data. This is important, but the user still has to make a decision at the end. With currently existing services they are often given an even greater pile of data that needs to be considered and sifted through. A good decision-making solution should help users make better decisions, but also help users make decisions more easily.
